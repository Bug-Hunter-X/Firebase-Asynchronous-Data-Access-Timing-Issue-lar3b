The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can occur in asynchronous operations where you're accessing the data within a callback function, but the data hasn't finished loading yet. For example, you could encounter errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')` if you attempt to access a field before the snapshot's data is populated.
